Crazy ideas for the team to build

## Todo
- Add commenting to posts (Disqus?)
- Make a nice simple theme that shows a lot of projects on the homepage, and displays code nicely.
- Give it a real url, make the site available
- Set up prose.io / any custom fields (Authors, people working on a project, tags, etc)
